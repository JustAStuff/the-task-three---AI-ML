# Housing Price Prediction - Linear Regression

This project demonstrates how to implement both simple and multiple linear regression using the Housing dataset.

## Objective

To predict housing prices based on features like area, bedrooms, bathrooms, and main road access using linear regression.

## Tools Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## Dataset

- Source: [Kaggle - Housing Price Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harishkumardatalab/housing-price-prediction)
- File: Housing.csv

## Steps Performed

1. Loaded and preprocessed the dataset
2. Encoded categorical features
3. Selected relevant features and target variable
4. Split the data into training and test sets
5. Trained a Linear Regression model
6. Evaluated the model using MAE, MSE, and RÂ² score
7. Visualized the regression line
8. Printed model coefficients and intercept

## How to Run

1. Install required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
